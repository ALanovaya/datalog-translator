# Datalog-translator
## Multidimensional Matrix Library
The Multidimensional Matrix Operations library provides a number of functions for creating, transforming, and manipulating matrices. Key operations include generating matrices, changing their shape, accessing and modifying elements, and obtaining submatrices. These operations are the basis for implementing more complex algorithms, such as matrix multiplication, which is used to compose relationships in Datalog.

## Translator of Datalog to linear algebra
The process of translating Datalog into matrix operations is a method of executing logical queries, thereby taking advantage of optimized computing libraries and hardware acceleration available for matrix operations. The translation process provides the basis for creating high-performance query processing systems that can handle large amounts of data and complex queries typical of modern applications in the field of big data and artificial intelligence.
